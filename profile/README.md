FlagEval, launched by BAAI in 2023, is a large model evaluation system that covers over 800 open-source and closed-source models globally. It includes more than 40 capability dimensions such as reasoning, mathematical skills, and task-solving abilities, along with five major tasks and four categories of metrics. In 2024, FlagEval successively launched the Colosseum and Debate Arena, platforms for model-to-model competition and battle.
